Simple Framework
================

This is a set of libraries for writing remote accessable code in a serverless way. Just implement a public static method in Java, place the @Endpoint annotation to the method, package it as a jar and place it in the simple-server. That's it. Now run the server and now you can access the Java static method via TCP.

More details will follow. I'm still busy writing code.

Kind regards,
